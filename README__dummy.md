# Ulight

A light **Framework** for Front-End Developer to build original and artistic websites!


## Getting Started

To use this framework, **copy the code** in the CSS file (src/assets/css/style.css).

Then **paste** it on your own CSS file (on your own project) and link it to your index.html.

You are now able to use all the **CSS classes** of the Framework!


### Prerequisites

You need to have an **HTML file** to link the CSS code of the Framework.


### Installing

- Go to **src/assets/css/style.css** on this repository
- **Copy the content** of the file
- Open your own project on your text editor
- Create a **new CSS file** (e.g. ulight.css)
- Paste the code you have copied from this repository on your new CSS file
- **Link your CSS file** on your main HTML file (usually index.html)

```
<link rel="stylesheet" src="/path-to-your-CSS-file/ulight.css">
```

- You can now use the Framework!


### Using

You can use the classes defined on the CSS file of the Framework like that:

- Find a class that interests you (e.g. `button-style`)
- Use the **class** by adding it on your HTML element (on the HTML file)

```
<button class="button-style">Click Me!</button>
```
